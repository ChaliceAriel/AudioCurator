# AudioCurator
An open source audio blog platform

## This branch of the Audio Curator project is currently being rebuilt as a Wordpress Theme!

The goal of Audio Curator is an open-source project that can be dowloaded as a package from GitHub, and then easily configured and customized by the blogger using various templates.  
Audio Curator will share your favorite music as a streaming playlist with short blog posts connected to each song. 
Additional features include an audio player interface and the ability for visitors to post comments.
